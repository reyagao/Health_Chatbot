Given the costs associated with MRI, additional evidence is needed to support the use of this technology, the study authors wrote. \n \n“We hope that the current findings will change how monitoring is done,” said Dr. Cafferty. “Reducing the number of scans, and particularly not scanning beyond 3 years, will not only reduce radiation exposure but will also reduce the burden of hospital visits for patients and for hospitals.”"
