Many individual foods that are low in fat or fat-free taste good. Some oils used in cooking and for dressings which are low in saturated fats (the type that increase blood cholesterol) and high in unsaturated fats (which may help to lower blood cholesterol), are healthy types of fat. For example, olive oil is rich in mono-unsaturated fats, and sunflower oil and corn oil are rich in poly-unsaturated fats. Using any of these oils in modest amounts for cooking or as dressings is fine as part of a healthy diet. Limit the consumption of fried food.\nMany types of nuts, such as almonds, walnuts, Brazil nuts, or hazelnuts, as well as peanuts and seeds like pumpkin seeds, are also rich in healthy oils, and a modest amount (about a handful daily) is a valuable part of a healthy diet."
