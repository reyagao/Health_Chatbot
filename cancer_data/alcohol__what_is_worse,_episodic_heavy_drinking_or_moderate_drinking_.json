Episodic heavy drinking of more than 5–6 alcoholic drinks for men or more than 4–5 alcoholic drinks for women on one occasion is referred to as binge drinking. It is on the rise in some countries (particularly in Ireland, Czech Republic and Ukraine), especially among young males and it has major detrimental health effects. Episodic heavy drinking, or binge drinking, may be even worse than regular drinking in terms of cancer risk. However, it must be emphasized that the risk of cancer clearly increases with the amount and duration of alcohol consumption."
