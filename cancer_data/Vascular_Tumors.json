The mean DOTANOC maximum standardized uptake value ratio of tumor and background was 6.9 (±1.4) (range, 3.8–9.5).

Severe hemorrhage is rare; however, trauma (biopsy, surgical procedure), ulceration, infection, or delay in initiating treatment may induce progression to disseminated intravascular coagulation, serious bleeding, and even death. Aggressive replacement of blood products, especially platelets, can increase the size of the lesion, causing significant pain and should only be considered with active bleeding and under the direction of a vascular anomalies specialist.[3] The mortality rate is unclear but it has been reported to be as high as 30%.[3,6]"

There are often areas of fibrosis, with dilated thin-walled vessels infiltrated around the areas of spindle cells. Mixed within these areas are nests of rounded epithelioid cells of vascular origin and aggregates of capillaries with round or irregularly shaped lumens containing platelet-rich fibrin thrombi. There are usually abnormal lymphatic spaces, either within or at the periphery of the lesion. The rate of mitosis is usually low but can be variable. Tufted angioma is characterized by multiple, discrete lobules of tightly packed capillaries (tufts) scattered in the dermis and sometimes in the subcutis, a so-called cannonball pattern.[7] Mitoses are rare."

Lesions harboring PIK3CA variants are frequently associated with overgrowth of adjacent tissues, as seen in patients with Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome and CLOVES syndrome (congenital lipomatous overgrowth, vascular malformations, epidermal nevis, spinal/skeletal anomalies/scoliosis).[7]"

The use of sirolimus in venous and lymphatic malformations is supported by level C evidence (case series, other observational study designs, phase II studies).[8-10] Both lesions with PIK3CA and TEK variants appear to respond equally to treatment with sirolimus. Phase III clinical trials are underway in Europe (e.g., NCT02638389, NCT03987152, and NCT04980872). A 2018 study reported promising level C evidence for the use of the PI3K inhibitor BYL719 (alpelisib) to treat patients who have lesions with a PIK3CA variant.[11] From these studies, preliminary FDA approval has been obtained.

DOTANOC expression was noted in all 19 cases of primary juvenile nasopharyngeal tumors (100%). The mean DOTANOC maximum standardized uptake value ratio of tumor and background was 6.9 (±1.4) (range, 3.8–9.5). Intracranial extension in 13 of 19 patients was prominently visualized because of the absence of DOTANOC uptake in the brain. The authors suggested that these findings open up possibilities for physiological diagnostic imaging, with a promise of greater specificity and sensitivity. This scan may be applicable in ambivalent diagnostic situations, such as the detection of recurrence."
