  "content": "## Is drinking small amounts of alcohol good for my heart?\nIs drinking small amounts of alcohol good for my heart?\nThe effect of drinking alcohol on the heart depends on the amount consumed and the frequency of consumption. Drinking more than one drink per day for women or more than two drinks per day for men increases the risks of stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease, and the more you drink, the higher the risk. Some studies have shown that people at high risk of heart disease, especially middle-aged men, who drink limited amounts of alcohol (less than one drink per day for women or less than two drinks per day for men), have a slightly lower risk of coronary heart disease compared with people who donâ€™t drink at all. However, it is not clear whether the alcoholic drinks themselves are responsible for that effect. Other factors (including a healthy diet, physical activity, not smoking, and maintaining a healthy body weight) reduce the risk of heart disease more effectively. Non-drinkers are not recommended to start drinking to help reduce heart disease risk."
