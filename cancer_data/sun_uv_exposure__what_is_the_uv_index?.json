  "content": "## What is the UV Index?\nWhat is the UV Index?\nThe Global Solar UV Index, or UV Index, expresses the measured or predicted amount/intensity of the ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun at a particular place on a particular day. In many countries, it is reported in daily weather forecasts, particularly in summer, to inform the general public about the intensity of the sun and the levels of sun protection measures needed. Many weather forecasts on the Internet include information about the UV Index.\nIn Figure 2, the levels of the UV Index are explained and corresponding suggestions for the necessary protection measures are given.\nFigure 2:\nUV Index\nSource: Reproduced, with the permission of the publisher, from Global Solar UV Index: A Practical Guide.
