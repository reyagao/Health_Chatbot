However, be aware that some restaurants and bars serve larger drinks than the standard. Also, there are differences in the assumed size and strength of a standard drink across European countries.\nFigure 1:\nA standard drink: standard sizes of beer, wine, and spirits, which each contain approximately 10–12 grams of pure alcohol.\nSource: © pixhook - iStockphoto.com\nFrom left to right: 10–12 grams of pure alcohol are contained in a 280-330 ml of beer, 150-180 ml of champagne, 30-40 ml of whisky or high-strength spirit, 60-80 ml of liqueur, and 100-120 ml of red wine."
