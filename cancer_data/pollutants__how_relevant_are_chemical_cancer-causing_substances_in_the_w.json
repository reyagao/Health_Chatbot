A relatively low risk for the individual, such as that of lung cancer caused by air pollution or\nsecond-hand smoke\n, may result in a significant number of cancer cases in the population if many people are exposed, whereas heavy exposure in a relatively small group of workers will result in a high cancer risk among the exposed individuals but will cause only a small number of cancers in the entire population."
