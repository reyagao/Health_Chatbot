  "content": "## Is there such a thing as a “healthy tan”?\nIs there such a thing as a “healthy tan”?\nTanning of the skin is a protective reaction of the skin to damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or intense artificial UV sources (like sunbeds). Therefore, a tanned skin is a sign of sun damage, and there is no such thing as a “healthy tan”. If the sun exposure is intense and for a longer duration, you will develop a sunburn.\nSun exposure also causes moles and freckles and, in the longer term, causes ageing of the skin. If the skin ages due to UV exposure, it will thicken and lose its elasticity more quickly; you can develop “age spots”, changes in skin colour (discoloration), wrinkles, enlarged or dilated blood capillaries in the skin, and skin cancer."
