  "content": "## What are electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes)?\nWhat are electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes)?\nElectronic cigarettes or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are devices that do not burn or use tobacco leaves but instead vaporize nicotine which the user then inhales. These products are most commonly referred to as e-cigarettes and using e-cigarettes is commonly referred to as ‘vaping’. Although some e-cigarettes look like conventional tobacco products (e.g. cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, pipes, hookahs, or shishas), they may be produced in the form of everyday items such as pens, USB memory sticks and larger cylindrical or rectangular devices.\nThe other main constituents of the fluid besides nicotine are propylene glycol and vegetable glycerine. In addition, e-cigarette liquids and emissions usually contain other chemicals. E-cigarettes come in a variety of flavours.\nUpdate: IARC endorses the\nWorld Health Organisation (WHO)\nstatement based on the current scientific evidence:\nWHO: E-cigarettes: how risky are they?\nThe link to the WHO statement posted on 29\n/01/2020 by the IARC provides recent information related to this Q\nuestion and A\nnswer of the European Code against Cancer posted on 14/10/2014. The European Code against Cancer Working Group on Tobacco developed\nthis Q\nnswer\nbut had no involvement in the development of the WHO statement."
