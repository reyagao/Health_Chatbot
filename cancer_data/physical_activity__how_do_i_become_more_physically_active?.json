Simply standing or walking instead of sitting can be beneficial. For example, if you commute using public transportation, get off a couple of stops earlier and walk the remaining distance. If you commute by car, purposely park a bit further away from your office to increase your amount of walking. Whenever possible, try to use the stairs instead of escalators or elevators. When using the telephone, stand instead of sitting. Reducing the time you spend sitting will increase the amount of energy you expend and can thereby help prevent weight gain over time. This will indirectly help decrease your risk of cancer.\nThere are a number of ways to fit more moderate to vigorous physical activity into your day. Get started by finding activities you really enjoy doing. Many different activities count, such as walking, dancing, or cycling. Consider trying a new type of activity, such as light jogging or recreational swimming. Also, work out with a friend or your partner, because that can help you stay motivated to get up and move.\nFind an activity that suits you and make a habit of it."
