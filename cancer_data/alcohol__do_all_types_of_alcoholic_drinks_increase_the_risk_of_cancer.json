Alcohol in any form increases the risk of cancer since alcohol itself causes damage. The main types of alcoholic drinks are wine, beer, and spirits, but any drink that contains alcohol can cause cancer. Alcoholic drinks have different alcohol contents. Be aware that some spirits can contain particularly high percentages of alcohol, and some types of beer can have much higher alcohol content than average."
