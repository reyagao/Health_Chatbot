Do as much light activity as possible (such as standing, walking, light bicycling, stretching, climbing the stairs, doing housework, and participating in leisurely sports such as table tennis or golf). Accumulating even small amounts of physical activity throughout the day is beneficial. Also, limit the time you spend being sedentary, such as sitting or watching television. Limiting the time you spend sitting can help protect against cancer risk by keeping you from gaining weight.\nIn addition, important health benefits can be expected when trying to engage in at least 150 minutes of physical activity of moderate intensity per week, or 75 minutes of physical activity of vigorous intensity per week, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity, if possible. Examples of moderate-to-vigorous physical activities are weight-bearing endurance, resistance types of physical activity (i.e. exercise training), and vigorous aerobic exercises. If you are unsure about engaging in moderate to vigorous activity, ask your physician. The recommended times of physical activity per week, can be obtained by cumulating short sessions or by having a longer one.\nChildren and young people should accumulate at least 60 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity per day. To achieve the goal of 60 minutes per day, they may perform activities in multiple shorter sessions spread throughout the day (e.g. 2 sessions of 30 minutes)."
