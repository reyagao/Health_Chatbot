Since the workplace directly influences the health and well-being of workers and consequently their families, communities, and society, it offers an ideal setting and infrastructure to support preventive and health promotion measures for large populations, including\nsmoking cessation\n,\nincreased physical activity\n, and\nhealthy diet\n. Combining the efforts of employers, employees, and society through occupational health programmes or promoting healthy lifestyles, and increasing workersâ€™ participation in shaping the working environment, may improve the health and well-being of people at work."
