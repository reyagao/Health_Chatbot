  "content": "## Why does drinking alcohol cause cancer?\nWhy does drinking alcohol cause cancer?\nThere are several reasons why drinking alcohol causes cancer. It is likely that different cancers are caused in different ways, for example:\nEthanol and acetaldehyde\n: alcohol (ethanol) is converted in our bodies into a chemical called acetaldehyde. Both ethanol and acetaldehyde are cancer-causing substances.\nLiver cirrhosis\n: alcohol damages the cells of the liver and can cause a disease called liver cirrhosis. Cirrhosis makes you more likely to develop liver cancer.\nHormones\n: alcohol can increase the levels of some hormones, such as estrogen. High levels of estrogen increase the risk of breast cancer."
