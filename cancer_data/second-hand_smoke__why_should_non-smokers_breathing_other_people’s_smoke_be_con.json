Examples of these chemicals are carcinogens like tobacco-specific nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).\nStudies based on non-smokers have found that those who inhale second-hand smoke at work and/or at home regularly have twice the risk of developing lung cancer compared with non-smokers who do not inhale second-hand smoke."
