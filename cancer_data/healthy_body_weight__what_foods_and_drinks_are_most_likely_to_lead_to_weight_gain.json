These foods are generally high in fat or sugar (or both). Particular culprits are highly processed manufactured foods that are often fried (“fast foods”), such as burgers, or fries, as well as fried snack foods such as crisps, and confectionery. Also, having lots of sugary drinks, such as soft drinks or fizzy drinks, or fatty and sugary drinks such as smoothies and milkshakes, is linked to weight gain. Fruit juices can also contain as many calories from their natural sugars as sweetened manufactured drinks do, and therefore should not be consumed in large amounts. Alcoholic drinks also have a high calorie content. Eating a lot of\nmeat\nhas also been linked to weight gain. And the less active you are, the more likely it is that high-calorie foods and drinks will make you gain weight.
