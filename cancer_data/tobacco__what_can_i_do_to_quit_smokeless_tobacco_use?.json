Behavioural support has been shown to increase abstinence rates among smokeless tobacco users for up to 6 months. The likelihood of quitting can be increased when telephone support with follow-up is added. Oral examination with feedback about oral health in dental settings may contribute to stop smokeless tobacco use. Smokeless tobacco users wanting to quit should seek advice on how to stop use from an appropriately trained health professional."
