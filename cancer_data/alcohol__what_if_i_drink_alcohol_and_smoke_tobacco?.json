  "content": "## What if I drink alcohol and smoke tobacco?\nWhat if I drink alcohol and smoke tobacco?\nThe combination of\ntobacco smoking\nand alcohol drinking is particularly hazardous, and the combined cancer risk from these two exposures is particularly high. Drinking alcohol makes it easier for the tissues of the mouth and throat to absorb the carcinogenic chemicals contained in tobacco smoke. This is one reason why people who drink and smoke multiply tissue damage and have especially high risks of cancers of the mouth and throat (upper respiratory tract) and gullet (oesophagus)."
