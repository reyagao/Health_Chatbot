If you are younger than about 55 years of age, though, it makes sense to take action to stay in the healthy weight range as it is quite common for people to gain weight over the years. If you are older than 55 and in the healthy weight range, then you probably don’t need to change your habits for weight control – but it is worth making sure you follow\nhealthy eating\nguidance to help reduce the likelihood of heart disease and cancer."
