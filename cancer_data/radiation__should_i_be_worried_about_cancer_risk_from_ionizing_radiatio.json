In the vast majority of situations, the combination of good regulatory control over radiation and radioactive material, good clinical judgement in the medical setting and good attention to indoor radon, can keep radiation exposures and the associated cancer risk very low. Industrial uses of radiation and radioactivity are governed by strict regulations. Under normal operating conditions, average public radiation exposures from these sources are very small. Nuclear sites that hold radioactive material are required to have safety arrangements and emergency response plans including arrangements to inform and protect people living nearby.\nFigure 4:\nSources of radiation\nSource: Adapted with permission from ec.europa.eu/research/energy/euratom/index_en.cfm?pg=fission§ion=protection, accessed 10 March 2014."
