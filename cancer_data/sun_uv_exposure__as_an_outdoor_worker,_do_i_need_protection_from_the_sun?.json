Outdoor workers are generally heavily exposed to the sun, all year round, for example construction workers or gardeners. Outdoor workers should therefore\nprotect\nthemselves carefully, by using protective clothing, by applying appropriate sunscreens, and through shade provision, if possible.\nDue to the sun exposure, outdoor workers are at higher risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancer. Certain types of skin cancer can be regarded as\noccupational disease\n."
