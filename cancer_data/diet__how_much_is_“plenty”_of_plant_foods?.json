  "content": "## How much is “plenty” of plant foods?\nHow much is “plenty” of plant foods?\nThere is no precise scientific definition of what is meant by the term “plenty” in relation to these recommended\nplant foods\n.\nThere are different types of plant foods – vegetables and fruits; pulses like beans, peas or lentils; like rice, pasta, or bread (preferably\nwholegrain\n) and nuts and seeds. The scientific evidence shows that the benefits of eating vegetables and fruits, and pulses, nuts and seeds generally increase as the amount consumed increases – that is, the more you eat the better. Cereals and cereal products especially if refined can contribute to excess calorie intake so should not be consumed in excess."
