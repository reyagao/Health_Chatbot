In some occupational settings, or over the working history of an individual, there is the possibility of being exposed to several occupational cancer-causing substances simultaneously or in sequence. Typical combinations are:\nradon\nor\narsenic\nand\ncrystalline silica\n;\nasbestos\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)\n; or\nchromium\nand nickel compounds.\nSmoking often adds substantially to the risk related to occupational cancer-causing substances. For example, the risk of lung cancer in asbestos workers is much higher in those who also smoke, and\nsmoking\nis a stronger risk factor in these individuals than is asbestos."
