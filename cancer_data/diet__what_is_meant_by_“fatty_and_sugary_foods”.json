Most highly processed and packaged foods will give this\ninformation on the label\n. This information can also be used to check the saturated fat content of food (a high-saturated-fat food would contain more than 5 grams of saturated fat per 100 grams of food).\nThe more fat or sugar a food contains, the more calories it has – and the more calories a food has in a given weight of food (energy dense foods), the easier it may be for you to eat too much of it. As a guide, high-calorie foods contain more than about 225–275 calories in 100 grams of food."
