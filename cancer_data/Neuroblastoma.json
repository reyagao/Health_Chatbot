Treatment included chemotherapy, surgical removal of the primary tumor, radiation to the tumor bed, high-dose myeloablative therapy plus stem cell transplant, and, in most cases, isotretinoin and anti-GD2 antibody immunotherapy enhanced by cytokines. Primary tumor response was measured after induction chemotherapy in three ways: as 30% or greater reduction in the longest dimension, 50% or greater reduction in tumor volume, or 65% or greater reduction in tumor volume (calculated from three tumor dimensions, a conventional radiological technique). The measurements were performed at diagnosis and after induction chemotherapy before primary tumor resection.

The International Society of Paediatric Oncology Europe Neuroblastoma (SIOPEN) biology group investigated the prognostic significance of this neuroblastoma subtype. Tumor tissue from 99 patients identified as having hetMNA and diagnosed between 1991 and 2015 was analyzed to elucidate the prognostic significance of MYCN-amplified clones in otherwise non-MYCN–amplified neuroblastomas. Patients younger than 18 months showed a better outcome in all stages compared with older patients. The genomic background correlated significantly with relapse frequency and OS. No relapses occurred in cases of only numerical chromosomal aberrations.

As a result of further advances in the understanding of neuroblastoma biology and genetics, a risk classification system was developed that incorporates clinical and biological factors in addition to INSS stage to facilitate risk group and treatment assignment for COG studies.[1,18-20] The final use of the INSS by the COG was for the intermediate-risk ANBL0531 (NCT00499616) study, which was closed in 2014."

Presence of IDRFs has been associated with an increase in intraoperative complications, incomplete tumor resection, and worse survival in numerous studies.[21-23] Since 2014, COG and SIOPEN clinical trials have used the INRGSS, a preoperative staging system that was developed specifically for the INRG classification system (see Table 3), in place of the INSS."

An updated report describes the results of a propensity matching analysis that compared patients who were treated with eflornithine with patients in the ANBL0032 trial who were not treated with eflornithine.[58] Propensity matching generally balanced differences in available patient characteristics. In the matched analysis, patients in the eflornithine cohort had statistically significantly higher EFS and OS, compared with patients in the non-eflornithine cohort (4-year EFS rates, 84% vs. 73% and 4-year OS rates, 96% vs. 84%).

Dinutuximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule called GD2, which is found on the surface of neuroblastoma cells, but is not present on many healthy or normal cells in the body. When dinutuximab binds to the neuroblastoma cells, it helps signal the immune system to kill the tumor cells. This helps the cells of the immune system kill the cancer cells, this is a type of immunotherapy. When chemotherapy and immunotherapy are given together, during the same treatment cycle, it is called chemoimmunotherapy. This clinical trial randomly assigns patients to receive either standard chemotherapy and surgery or chemoimmunotherapy (chemotherapy plus dinutuximab) and surgery during Induction therapy. Chemotherapy drugs administered during Induction include, cyclophosphamide, topotecan, cisplatin, etoposide, vincristine, and doxorubicin. These drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing or by stopping them from spreading. Upon completion of 5 cycles of Induction therapy, a disease evaluation is completed to determine how well the treatment worked. If the tumor responds to therapy, patients receive a tandem transplantation with stem cell rescue. If the tumor has little improvement or worsens, patients receive chemoimmunotherapy on Extended Induction. During Extended Induction, dinutuximab is given with irinotecan, temozolomide. Patients with a good response to therapy move on to Consolidation therapy, when very high doses of chemotherapy are given at two separate points to kill any remaining cancer cells. Following, transplant, radiation therapy is given to the site where the cancer originated (primary site) and to any other areas that are still active at the end of Induction. The final stage of therapy is Post-Consolidation. During Post-Consolidation, dinutuximab is given with isotretinoin, with the goal of maintaining the response achieved with the previous therapy. Adding dinutuximab to Induction chemotherapy along with standard of care surgical resection of the primary tumor, radiation, stem cell transplantation, and immunotherapy may be better at treating children with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma."

This trial combines two different ways of fighting cancer: antibodies and natural killer T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with viruses and tumor cells. GD2-CAR natural killer T cells are modified immune cells that have been engineered in the laboratory to specifically target GD2 proteins found on neuroblastoma tumor cells and kill them.

Donor gamma-delta T cells are immune cells taken from a healthy donor and infused back into the body for treatment. Donor gamma-delta T cells work in the body by activating the body's immune system to create more healthy cells that will directly kill the tumor cells. Dinutuximab is a drug that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating newly diagnosed patients with neuroblastoma who complete other therapy and it has also been used to treat patients with relapsed/ refractory neuroblastoma. It is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins made in the laboratory (lab), designed to attach to specific targets on cancer cells. Dinutuximab was designed to attach to a target called GD-2 that is common on neuroblastoma cells. When dinutuximab attaches to the GD-2 target on neuroblastoma cells, the gamma-delta T cells can be stimulated to attack and kill the neuroblastoma cells. Temozolomide is a chemotherapy that is commonly given to neuroblastoma patients at relapse. Irinotecan is in a class of antineoplastic medications called topoisomerase I inhibitors. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair and may kill cancer cells. Clinical trials showed that patients had much better tumor responses to dinutuximab given with temozolomide compared to other dinutuximab combinations in the same study, leading to this combination being studies in patients with newly diagnosed high risk neuroblastoma. Zoledronate is a drug given by intravenous (IV) that has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of other cancers. Zoledronate has also been used and safely given to children with solid tumor cancers such as neuroblastoma. Zoledronate has been found in lab tests to make gamma-delta T cells more active in killing neuroblastoma tumor cells. Giving donor gamma-delta T cells dinutuximab, temozolomide, irinotecan and zoledronate may work better in treating children with refractory, recurrent, or progressive neuroblastoma or osteosarcoma."
