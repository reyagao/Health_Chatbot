What if I drink alcohol and smoke tobacco?\nYes. The harmful effects of tobacco are increased by consumption of alcohol drinking and also in certain occupations that expose workers to other agents known to cause cancer (e.g.\nradon\nor\nasbestos\n). For alcohol consumption and smoking, the risk of cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, and oesophagus increases substantially with rising alcohol consumption in smokers. Smoking and\ndrinking alcohol\nput you at higher cancer risk than if you only smoke."
