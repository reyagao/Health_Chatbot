Because we only need to overeat a little over several years to put on quite a lot of weight, it is quite easy to do this without really noticing. And because most of us don’t have to do much physical activity as part of our everyday lives (at work or at home, or travelling) and because there is plenty of high-calorie food – especially highly processed “fast food” and sugary drinks – easily available, it is actually quite usual for people to gradually gain weight during adult life. On average people gain about 400 grams every year – that’s 4 kilograms in 10 years and 6 kilograms in 15 years. That’s why it is recommended to do something positive to control your weight – if you ignore it, you are quite likely to gradually gain weight without meaning to."
