How can radon levels at work be reduced, if necessary?\nWorkplaces, including ordinary offices and shops, can have high radon levels in the same way as homes. Radon exposure at work should be managed by the employer as an occupational health risk. The actions needed to manage workplace radon levels are generally similar to those for homes, and include checking whether the workplace is in an area where high radon levels are more likely, and if so, measuring radon levels in the workplace. High radon levels in the workplace can generally be reduced using the same methods that are used for homes."
