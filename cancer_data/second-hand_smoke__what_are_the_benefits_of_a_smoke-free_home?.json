  "content": "## What are the benefits of a smoke-free home?\nWhat are the benefits of a smoke-free home?\nSmoke-free homes reduce adults’ and children’s exposure to second-hand smoke.\nSmoke-free homes protect adults and children who are especially vulnerable to second-hand smoke, for example those with asthma (or adults with heart disease or chronic lung disease).\nTeenagers of non-smoking parents who live in homes where smoking is allowed are more likely to start smoking than those who live in homes where smoking is prohibited.\nSmokers living in smoke-free homes smoke fewer cigarettes per day.\nSmoke-free homes help quitters remain abstinent longer.\nA smoke-free home policy is a clear message that smoking is unacceptable.\nA smoke-free home, in which no one is allowed to smoke inside the house at any time under any circumstances, is more effective in protecting children from exposure to second-hand smoke than are partial restrictions. Smoking by the window, or in the doorway, does not make the home smoke-free.\nAdditional reduction of exposure to second-hand smoke is achievable by not smoking in cars and other private vehicles when children and non-smokers are present. High concentrations of second-hand smoke have been detected in cars when smoking takes place, and opening the car’s windows is not effective in eliminating exposure to second-hand smoke. In 2014, England approved a policy banning smoking in private vehicles when children are passengers. This law will go into effect in about a year. A similar policy project is in the pipeline in Ireland and other countries are expected to follow."
