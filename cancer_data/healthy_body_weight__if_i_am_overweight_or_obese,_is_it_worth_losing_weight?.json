If you are overweight or obese or gaining weight, it is always worth losing some weight. There is some evidence that weight loss is associated with reduced cancer risk, and a very large amount of evidence that losing weight is valuable in reducing risk of diabetes, or even helping to cure it, as well as several risk factors for heart disease and stroke, such as blood cholesterol and blood pressure. The good news is that however overweight you are, you can start to get some of this health benefit even if you lose just a few kilograms. Although you should aim to get into the healthy-weight range (BMI 18.5–25 kg/m\n2\n) for major health benefit, any weight loss will provide you some benefit – so it is quite achievable."
