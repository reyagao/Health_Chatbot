The main cause of cervical cancer is persistent infection with high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV), an extremely common family of viruses that are transmitted through sexual contact. Vaccines exist that protect against high-risk HPV types, and screening programmes can detect signs of disease at an early stage, allowing for effective treatment and management of the condition. This means that cervical cancer should be one of the most preventable and treatable forms of cancer. In many high-income countries, this is the case. High incidence rates and high mortality rates of cervical cancer occur mainly (~90% for both) in low- and middle-income countries.\n## News & Events\nNews\n## IARC marks International HPV Awareness Day\nIARC marks International HPV Awareness Day\n04.03.2025\n03.03.2025\nIARC launches project to introduce and improve cancer screening in Slovenia\n25.02.2025\nA randomised controlled non-inferiority trial to compare the efficacy of ‘HPV screen, triage and treat’ with ‘HPV screen and treat’ approach for cervical cancer prevention among women living with HIV\nSEE MORE News & Events\n## Press Releases\n## New research highlights the potential of single-dose HPV vaccination  to advance cervical cancer prevention in low-resource settings\nNew research highlights the potential of single-dose HPV vaccination  to advance cervical cancer prevention in low-resource settings\n13.11.2024\n02.08.2024\nGlobal attribution of HPV genotypes to invasive cervical cancer: a systematic analysis\n25.06.2024\nNew study shows effectiveness of low-cost portable device for treating cervical precancers\nSEE MORE Press Releases\n## Highlights\n## IARC marks International HPV Awareness Day 2025\nIARC marks International HPV Awareness Day 2025\n03.01.2025\nIARC marks Cervical Cancer Awareness Month 2025\n30.04.2024\nCancer Screening in Five Continents (CanScreen5): a global data repository for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening programmes\nSEE MORE Highlights\n## Videos\n## Recommendations vs the real world: IARC compares WHO HPV screening guidelines, with Dr Smita Joshi\nRecommendations vs the real world: IARC compares WHO HPV screening guidelines, with Dr Smita Joshi\n10.01.2025\n24.09.2024\nIARC-developed AI tool for cervical cancer screening – Dr Partha Basu\nSEE MORE Videos\n## Infographics\n## IARC marks Cervical Cancer Awareness Month 2025\n18.11.2024\nCervical Cancer Elimination Day of Action 2024\n24.04.2024\nWorld Immunization Week 2024: Vaccination against HPV and hepatitis viruses\nSEE MORE Infographics\n## Cervical Cancer Awareness Month 2021Questions and Answers (Q&A)\nCervical Cancer Awareness Month 2021\nEvery few years, IARC publishes the latest global data on cancer incidence and mortality.
