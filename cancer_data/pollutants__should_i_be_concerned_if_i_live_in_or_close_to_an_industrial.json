  "content": "## Should I be concerned if I live in or close to an industrial area?\nShould I be concerned if I live in or close to an industrial area?\nThe best approach is to stay informed by consulting reliable sources of information, such as from local health authorities.\nIn some circumstances exposure to a variety of substances, for example air pollutants, may increase in the vicinity of industrial sites (e.g. incinerators, waste disposal sites, or processing mills), and occasionally may increase above the acceptable limits. In addition, there is often concern when the media reports findings of potentially toxic chemicals in water, food, soil, or air, and so-called “cancer clusters” (isolated high occurrences of cancer). However, there have been very few situations in the European Union in recent years where exposure to toxic chemicals has been linked to a corresponding increase in cancer occurrence. Nevertheless, every effort should be made to minimize and control exposures to the general population from polluting sites.\nAir pollution may also be high in areas of dense traffic. To reduce exposure to air pollution, joint action of the society and governments are needed. While regulation needs to be decided, established and monitored by government and alternatives to private car use need to be provided, every individual can contribute by using alternatives of public transportation, car sharing or using bicycles to contribute to less traffic."
