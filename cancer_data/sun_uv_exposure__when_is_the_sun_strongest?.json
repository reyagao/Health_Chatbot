Seasonal variations in UV radiation reaching the Earth’s surface are substantial in temperate regions but much less nearer to the equator.\nOther important factors that influence the strength of UV radiation at the Earth’s surface are:\nGeographical latitude\n(annual UV doses decrease with increasing distance from the equator).\nAltitude\n(in general, each 300 metres increase in altitude increases the sun-burning effectiveness of sunlight by about 4%).\nSurface reflection\n(e.g. snow, water) (snow reflects up to 85% of UV, and water about 5–10%; reflected UV can damage skin as much as direct UV).\nClouds\n(the amount by which the UV radiation reaching the Earth’s surface is reduced by clouds depends on the thickness, density, and shape of the clouds).\nAir pollution\n(like clouds, urban smog from air pollution modifies the amount of UV radiation reaching the Earth’s surface)."
