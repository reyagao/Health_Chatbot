The only specific difference is that for reducing risk of bowel cancer there is a recommendation to avoid processed meat and limit red meat consumption. Some studies have also linked these factors to heart disease but the evidence is not as strong as for bowel cancer. So the diet recommended above is not only good for reducing cancer risk but also for risk of other diseases. There is not strong evidence that particular foods (sometimes misleadingly called “superfoods”) can help reduce risk of cancer or of other chronic diseases, by themselves."
