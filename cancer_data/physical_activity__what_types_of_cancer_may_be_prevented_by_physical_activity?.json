These are among the most common cancers in Europe. Physical activity also helps keep you from gaining weight â€“ which will have an additional effect on reducing risks of these and other cancers, including kidney, pancreas, gullet (oesophageal) and gall bladder cancers. There is also some evidence that a lifestyle that reduces sedentary behaviours (avoids sitting for long periods of the day) may protect against endometrial cancer."
