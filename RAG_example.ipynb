            "**How to use Ollama:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Visit the website**: Go to [Ollama.com](http://ollama.com) in your web browser.\n",
            "2. **Create an account**: Click on \"Sign up\" and enter your email address, password, and username (optional).\n",
            "3. **Choose a theme**: Select a theme for your voice message from the available options or create your own.\n",
            "4. **Record your message**: Use the built-in microphone to record your voice message. You can speak as much or as little as you like.\n",
            "5. **Add audio effects (optional)**: If you want to add some flair to your message, you can use Ollama's built-in audio effects, such as echo, reverb, or speed.\n",
            "6. **Share your message**: Once you're happy with your recording, you can share it anonymously on the internet. You can share a link to your message via social media, messaging apps, or email.\n",

            "**Some additional tips:**\n",
            "\n",
